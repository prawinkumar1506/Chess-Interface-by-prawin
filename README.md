# Chess Learning Platform using Java

## Project Overview

The Chess Learning Platform is an interactive application designed to help users learn and improve their chess skills. The platform incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a structured and modular design, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability. With a user-friendly graphical interface, users can engage with various chess concepts, tactics, and strategies.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Chess Board:** Users can play chess against the computer or a friend, with real-time validation of moves and visual feedback on the chessboard.

- **Puzzle of the Day:** Daily puzzles challenge users to solve specific chess problems, enhancing their tactical skills and strategic thinking.

- **Load/Save/View Games:** Players can load previous games, save their current progress, and view past games to analyze their moves and strategies.

- **Grandmasters' Games:** Access a library of games played by grandmasters, allowing users to study high-level play and learn advanced strategies.

- **Learnings on Utilizing All Chess Pieces:** Educational resources are provided to help users understand the strengths and weaknesses of each chess piece and how to utilize them effectively in different scenarios.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:**
  - **Java:** The primary programming language used to implement the application's logic and features.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The application is designed using OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to promote code reusability and modularity.

- **GUI Framework:**
  - **Java Swing:** Utilized for creating the graphical user interface, allowing for the development of interactive components like buttons, menus, and panels that enhance the user experience.

- **Data Storage:**
  - **File I/O:** User profiles and game data are stored locally using file input/output operations.

## Current Status

We are currently working on the Chess Learning Platform, focusing on enhancing features and refining the user experience. The project is still in development, and we are committed to making it a valuable resource for chess learners.
